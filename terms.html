                    <div class="separator separator-danger">∎</div>
                    <p class="description">
                        The Creation of ĐAG tokens carries with it significant risk. Prior to Creating ĐAG tokens, carefully consider the exemplary and non-exhaustive list of risks set forth below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to Creating ĐAG tokens. 
                        <br><br>
                        1. Risk of Security Weaknesses in The ĐAG’s Software<br><span style="font-size:small;">
                        The ĐAG concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The ĐAG’s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the ĐAG software, causing the loss of ĐAG tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the ĐAG Token Holder’s accounts.<br></span><br>
                        2. Risk of Weakness in the ĐAG underlying blockchain, and/or Ethereum Network<br><span style="font-size:small;">
                        The ĐAG software is itself based on an unproven platform: the Ethereum blockchain. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to the Ethereum blockchain could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the Ethereum software, causing the loss of ĐAG tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the ĐAG Token Holder’s accounts.<br></span><br>
                        3. Risk of unforeseen attack vectors<br><span style="font-size:small;">
                        The field of Digital Cryptography is very new and for this reason, there is a risk of unforeseen attack both in terms of the underlying cryptographic protocol that back the functioning of the ĐAG as well as 'game theory' related vectors which have not been documented to date. Both these vectors represent a risk that could lead the loss of ĐAG tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the ĐAG Token Holder’s accounts.<br></span><br>
                        4. Regulatory risks<br><span style="font-size:small;">
                        Blockchain technology and Ethereum are allowing new forms of interactions between individuals and/or companies, some of them are still to be imagined and implemented. Like with the appearance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it is very likely that specific regulations will be set in different jurisdictions targeting blockchain technology and more specifically ĐAGs. These regulations may or may not be ĐAG friendly and some might even forbid any relationships between an individual or company and a ĐAG.<br></span><br>

                        <br><br>
                        You Create ĐAG tokens with your own actions. To the extent permitted by law, Third Parties or Individuals associated with the Creation of The ĐAG are not liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the Creation of ĐAG tokens.<br></span><br>

                        This document contains statements that are, or may be deemed to be, “forward looking statements” which are prospective in nature. These forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, or the negative thereof such as “outlook”, "plans", "expects" or "does not expect", "is expected", "continues", "assumes", "is subject to", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "aims", "forecasts", "risks", "intends", "positioned", "predicts", "anticipates" or "does not anticipate", or "believes", or variations of such words or comparable terminology and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "should", “shall”, "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current predictions, expectations, beliefs, opinions, plans, objectives, goals, intentions and projections about future events, results of operations, prospects, financial condition and discussions of strategy. By their nature, forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond anyone's control. 
                        <br><br>
                        Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may and often do differ materially from actual results. Important factors that could cause these uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the “Risks and uncertainties” of this document. None of the third parties provide any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which only speak as of the date of this document.
